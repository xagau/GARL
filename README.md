# GARL
Genetic Based Selection Forced Reinforcement Learning

Run using Java 1.8.

You can start it via:
```
java -jar GARL-1.0-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar
```

This is a work in progress. Payouts *almost work* on this version!

I've provided 20 "fit/train" evolved genomes.

Note: Requires Swing and a Desktop.
